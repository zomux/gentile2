when the fluid pressure cylinder 31 is used , fluid is gradually applied .
this relation must be maintained even after passing at least 100,000 sheets .
referring now to the accompanying drawings , a description will be given of the embodiments of the present invention .
in the case where the chassis is made to float in this manner , frictional drive is not provided , and propelling drive derived from magnetic induction , or auxiliary propelling drive using propellers is added .
in this case , it is necessary to support the chassis in contact with the road surface by means of the tires 2 until buoyancy sufficient to allow the chassis to float by means of the relative movement of air is produced .
it should be noted that magnetic suspension or the like may be employed as a means of supporting the chassis in a state of noncontact .
in addition , in order to run above the reaction plates , guidance along the reaction plates becomes necessary .
the guide 5 and the guide rollers 3 shown in FIGDOT 1 are designed to provide such guidance , and embodiments thereof will be described hereinunder .
in the embodiment shown in FIGDOT 30 , one guide 5 is laid at the center of the road surface , and the chassis 15 is supported by clamping the guide 5 by the guide rollers 3 attached to the chassis 15 , the view being taken from the front or rear of the vehicle .
basically , as shown in the plan view of FIGDOT 31 -LRB- a -RRB- , stability is secured by providing two sets of guide rollers 3 for clamping the guide 5 from both sides thereof to support the chassis 15 , and FIGDOT 31 -LRB- b -RRB- shows a front elevational view thereof .
the axle 9 is supported on a chassis 15 by means of a double wish bone type link 14 , and shocks are absorbed and alleviated by a coil spring 16 and a damper -LRB- not shown -RRB- .
in other words , in the embodiments shown in FIGSDOT 32 and 33 , running is effected in such a manner that the wheels 2 straddle the guides 5 in a manner similar to that shown in FIGDOT 30 .
the difference between FIGSDOT 30 and 32 lies in the difference between one guide 5 at the center or two guides 5 on the outer sides of the guide rollers 3 , and a vehicle having the same arrangement of the guide rollers 3 can be used with both .
next , a description will be given of examples of the arrangement of the guide rollers corresponding to the arrangement of the driving force generating means and the propelling force generating means described earlier .
FIGSDOT 35 to 39 are diagrams illustrating embodiments corresponding to the cases of the four wheeled vehicle shown in FIGSDOT 17 to 21 , and the embodiments shown in FIGSDOT 30 to 33 are applied thereto .
that is , two pairs of guide rollers 3 are disposed on the inner sides of the wheels 2 , the pairs being provided for the front and the rear wheels , respectively .
FIGSDOT 40 to 42 are diagrams illustrating embodiments corresponding to the cases of the three wheeled vehicle shown in FIGSDOT 22 to 24 , and the embodiment shown in FIGDOT 34 is applied thereto .
in the case of the three wheeled vehicle , since one wheel is present at the center as is apparent from its structure , the embodiment shown in FIGDOT 30 is not applicable , and FIGDOT 34 in which two guides 5 are laid on the opposite outer sides of the vehicle is easiest to apply .
as the method of supporting the axle 9 on the chassis 15 , it is possible to adopt another suspension system .
the arrangements shown in FIGSDOT 32 and 33 are also applicable , but the distance between the two guides 5 needs to be large enough not to constitute a hindrance to the wheel at the center .
it goes without saying that the embodiment shown in FIGDOT 34 is also applicable to these embodiments .
FIGDOT 47 is a diagram illustrating an embodiment in which the guide 5 and the guide rollers 3 are applied to the air floating vehicle shown in FIGDOT 29 , and the arrangements shown in FIGSDOT 30 to 34 can be applied thereto .
meanwhile , FIGDOT 48 is a diagram illustrating another embodiment in which the direction of travel of the air floating vehicle shown in FIGDOT 29 is guided , and a rudder 22 is mounted on a rear portion of the vehicle to guide the direction of travel of the vehicle 1 .
although in the foregoing embodiments a description has been given of the mechanism for guiding the direction of running in the case where running is effected by causing the vehicle to float by means of air or magnetism , running may be effected without causing the tires to come into contact with the reaction plates .
FIGSDOT 49 -LRB- a -RRB- and 49 -LRB- b -RRB- are diagrams illustrating an embodiment in which the tires are held in noncontact with the reaction plates by using carrying rails , and FIGDOT 50 is a diagram illustrating an example of how the guide rollers and the carriage rollers are attached .
in FIGSDOT 49 -LRB- a -RRB- and 49 -LRB- b -RRB- , a pair of carrying rails 31 are each disposed between the reaction plates 4 which in turn are positioned below the wheels 2 on the road surface , with the guide 5 laid at the center .
a pair of a carriage rollers are attached to the chassis 15 and support the overall vehicle on the carrying rails 31 .
as described above , since the wheel driving motor is comprised of the primary side fixed armature 13 and the secondary side rotary magnet 7 , the wheel 2 can be rotated by supplying electric current to the primary side fixed armature 13 and by controlling the supply current .
a fixed gap is secured between each wheel 2 and the reaction plate 4 by virtue of support by the carriage rollers 32 .
a description will now be given of the action of eddy currents acting in the reaction plate .
in the latter case , since the eddy current density is greatest at the upper side in the drawing , a reactionary force which is greater than the force acting on the opposite side -LRB- lower side in the drawing -RRB- tending to restore the position of the secondary side rotary magnet 7 toward the center of the reaction plate 4 acts on the secondary side rotary magnet 7 .
accordingly , the restoring force acts between the reaction plate 4 and the secondary side rotary magnet 7 in such a manner as to cause the tires to run at the center of the reaction plate 4 in the direction of running .
accordingly , the vehicle 1 equipped with the above described wheels 2 can run on conventional roads by making use of frictional force acting between the tires 6 and the road surface in the same way as a conventional automobile by means of the rotative drive of the wheel driving motors .
accordingly , if the secondary side rotary magnet rotates , the eddy current pattern in the reaction plate consecutively changes as shown in diagrams -LRB- a -RRB- , -LRB- b -RRB- , -LRB- c -RRB- , -LRB- d -RRB- , -LRB- e -RRB- , -LRB- f -RRB- , and -LRB- g -RRB- in FIGDOT 52c in that order .
it should be noted that the present invention is not restricted to the forgoing embodiments , and various modifications are possible .
for instance , although in the above described embodiments a description has been given of the arrangement in which a pair of reaction plates are disposed on the road surface opposing the secondary side rotary magnets , an arrangement may be alternatively provided such that each reaction plate may be divided or grooves are provided therein so as to control the pattern of the eddy current .
by virtue of such a measure , it is possible to change the eddy current density due to the running position and improve the running performance .
in addition , in a curved course , the reaction plate on the outer wheel side may be inclined in such a manner as to be raised relatively higher than the reaction plate on the inner wheel side .
as is apparent from the above description , in accordance with the present invention , since running is effected through propelling drive in noncontact with the road surface without resorting to frictional drive , it is possible to obtain a large driving force even on the , road surface of a low .mu. road or the like .
moreover , with reaction plates laid on the road surface , it is possible to effect positive and stable running on any road surface without being affected by the road surface environment .
in addition , since the running of the vehicle is not based on the frictional drive through friction between the wheels and the road surface , even if wheels are adopted as a means of holding the chassis on the road surface , the wheels practically do not undergo wear , and it is possible to attain high speed running .
furthermore , since the propelling force generating means is comprised of the rotary magnet , and the rotary magnet is comprised of the rotor of the electric motor for driving the rotary magnet , the driving devices of the vehicle can be made compact in size .
in addition , on a road where the reaction plates 4 are laid as shown in FIGDOT 1 , the vehicle 1 is capable of running by making use of the frictional force between the tires 6 and the reaction plates 4 as well as running by making use of the propelling force derived from magnetic induction occurring in the reaction plates 4 through the rotation of the secondary side rotary magnets 7 .
additionally , by simply effecting the changeover control of the supply current to the fixed magnets , it is possible to obtain the noncontact propelling driving force , making it possible to make the driving device compact .
moreover , the second driving force generating means is comprised of an electric motor or engine constituting the first driving force generating means , and since the rotary magnets and the wheels are rotated by the electric motors or the engine , the vehicle can be made compact in size .
in a transportation system using the vehicle with a noncontact drive mechanism , it is possible to realize a transportation system in which the vehicle is capable of running positively and stably on any road surface without being affected by the road surface environment , with relatively simple facilities involving the laying of reaction plates and a guide and carrying rails for controlling the running direction .
in addition , since running is based on noncontact drive , it is possible to effect high speed running .
that is , the vehicle 1 is capable of running by contact drive based on the frictional force and by noncontact drive based on the propelling force derived from magnetic induction .
in addition , in the case of noncontact drive based on the propelling force derived from magnetic induction with the wheels 2 floating -LRB- spaced from -RRB- the reaction plates 4 , the vehicle 1 runs along the guide 5 laid on the road by means of the guide rollers 3 disposed on the vehicle 1 .
the vehicle 1 is adapted to run by producing a propelling force between a pair of left- and right hand reaction plates 4 on the one hand , and the wheels 2 on the other , along a guide 5 laid on a road surface r .
as a result , it becomes possible to apply the propelling force derived from magnetic induction to a vehicle for running magnetic induction road surface , such as an automobile , which requires a large propelling force .
as described above , in accordance with the present invention , the magnetic induction propelling force is provided by the secondary side rotary magnet 7 , and the first driving force generating means is the motor for the wheel 2 which is constituted by the primary side fixed armature 13 and the secondary side rotary magnet 7 .
thus , in accordance with the present invention , since the propelling force is produced between the secondary side rotary magnet 7 and the reaction plate 4 by magnetic induction , even in cases where the tires 6 slip on a road surface having a low coefficient of friction -LRB- low .mu. road surface -RRB- , such as a frozen road surface , and frictional running is impossible , the vehicle 1 can be propelled by the propelling force derived from magnetic induction .
moreover , in that case , since the secondary side rotary magnet 7 which is the rotor for the motor for the wheel 2 is also used to generate propelling force based on magnetic induction , the number of component parts used is small , and the structure can be made compact .
